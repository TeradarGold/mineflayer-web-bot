Run up to 50 minecraft java bots on a server and control their chat. (Microsoft Accounts Only)


HOW TO RUN?

1. Download the Zip file
2. Move the zip file into a folder and extract the contents of the Zip file into the folder
3. Run the file "FirstTimeRun.bat", this will install all dependencies, should take less than a minute depending on your internet speed + computer speed
4. Run the file "start_app.bat", this will start the application
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/general to use the bot! Make sure to equip darkmode on the top right if your eyes hurt. Try not to refresh the page while program is running.

You will need to log in to the microsoft accounts under the section called "Auth Data".

To send chat through a bot:
- When the bot is connected to the server, click on the dropdown called "Select Bot" and choose the bot you want to use (Bot0, Bot1, etc). Then send a message through the "type your message here" box and click send.


Things that don't work:

Connect Message currently does not work, you will need to individually send messages.
Sending a chat message under the "All" bot function does not work, you will need to send messages individually.
